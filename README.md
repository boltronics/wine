## Patched Wine releases ##

This repository contains various branches containing normal Wine
releases, with patches applied either from wine-staging or attached to
bug reports.

In general, each branch will be specific to a particular application I
want to get running, and will involve the minimum number of patch sets
required to reach that goal. This may be helpful when testing and
reporting bugs.
